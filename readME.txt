COMPILE COMMAND

To compile the program correctly:
use command Make to create and compile all the necessary files and then use "./a3" to run the program.

Program Description

Main File: Prompts the user a number from 1-8. a while loop is used to reprint the menu after each option untill or unless user chooses to exits.

Menu Option 1(Function: createTweet):  The user is being asked to enter a tweet.First the user is asked of entering a username followed by the tweet.
Right after this the userID is generated by the computer. The UserID is made by (sum of ascii values of characters in the username) + (length of the userâ€™s tweet).

Menu Option 2(Function: displayTweets):  This option Displays all the tweets that are currently in the memory. I used a while loop to traverse through the tweelist till NULL pointer and printed out the 
information in a organized way.

Menu Option 3(Function: searchTweetsByKeyword):  Search for tweets is done by a keyword. So first the user is asked for the keyword. And then i used tolower in built c function to turn this keyword to lower case to account for case insensitive.
I also used a seperate char variable tweetString to store the tweets from the tweetlist in lower case using tolower. After that I traversed the tweelist till null pointer and used strstr another builtin c fucntion to find 
any keyword match in the tweets. If match is found 1 is being returned and o otherwise.

Menu Option 4(Function: countStopWords):  At first a while loop is travered till the end of linked list. Each time the loop runs again the content of tweet from text is stored in a temp variable. Right after that the new line character is chnaged to a null character in the text of the tweet.A pointer 
character word is declared which will traverse each word in the text of tweet by using strtok builtin c function. Each word is found by " .;?:1". A for loop is used to traverse all the stop words and to compare with word pointer variable. if a match is found numStopwords is being increased by 1 so count number of stop words. 

Menu Option 5(Function: deleteTweet):  Firstly the tweelist is being traversed and it counts number of tweets present. Then prompts the user to ask the nth tweet to delete. if there are no nodes in the TweetList it means the tweetlist is empty so nothing can
be deleted adn it exits the function. Otherwise if the value of n is 1 then the node with the head pointer is deleted and that node's memory is Free-ed. if the value of n is other than 1 then the next pointer in tweet temp is looped till n-2 to reach the nth node
When the nth node pointer is found, that node is initialized to another Tweet struct temp2. The next pointer of temp2 is given to the next pointer of temp1 so link the list back togther. Lastly the memory of temp2 is Free-ed therefore tweet deleted.

Menu Option 6(Function:saveTweetsToFile): File pointer is declared and a variable filename where the filename is stored when prompted from the user. The tweetlist is travered in while loop till the null pointer and fprintf is used to print the content from the tweetlist seperated by comma
into the file of user's choice.

Menu Option 7(Function:loadTweetsFromFile): A file pointer is declared. a char filename variable is declared which will store the name of the file from which to load the tweets from. the user is prompted which file to load the tweets from. Then we use fopen function to open the file correctly.
Then i kept a if condition to check if the file has opened correctly or not. if not then it'll display the message that file not opened and the function is exited.Otherwise a while loop is started to read the content from the filename into  char variable  fileText using fgets till end of file.
Then i also dynamiclly alocate memory for a struct tweet tempTweet to be initialized. The next thing it does is finds a newline character or ',' and changes the second last character of fileText to a null character.I have also declared a character pointer varaible commas. Using strtok commas will
contain everything till the first ',' found in fileText. the first thing i finds will be userID which is initialzied to id element of struct tempTweet. The next component after the first comma is username which is copied to user element of the tempTweet. followed by the text element of the struct 
tempTweet. inside the while loop i have also made a condition = 1 if tweets are being imported. This condition will display appropriate display message if tweets have been imported.

Function addNodeToList: if the tweetlist is NULL that means the tweetlist is empty so the node which is being passed to this fuction is made the head of the linked list. otherwise the node is added to the end to of the list.

IMPROVMENT FOR FUTURE

-My program doesnt efficently allocates memory for new tweets which are made.
